// SPEC §6.6/§9.4/§10.3 (plans/secure-framework.md MARQUEE): the framework-owned managed DB handle.
//
// This is the shipped KV433 Stage-1 runtime floor (the read-only loader proxy) unified with KV422
// (the SQL-safe managed handle). Where Kovo owns and threads the handle, loaders receive one
// managed read handle and mutations receive one managed write handle:
//
//   - `managedDb(raw, 'read')`  → SQL-safe (KV422) + read capability proxy (KV433). A `query()`
//     loader receives only the framework-approved read surface; every other property fails closed
//     at runtime and is absent from the `Reader<Db>` type mirror.
//   - `managedDb(raw, 'write')` → SQL-safe (KV422) only. A `mutation()` or other explicit write
//     surface gets the full read-write handle.
//
// The read-only proxy is the safe-default runtime backstop; the KV433 direct static no-write-
// reachable check remains the by-construction guarantee, while broader interprocedural write-
// summary work is still residue (SPEC §6.6/§10.3: proxies are defense-in-depth, never sold as the
// proof).
